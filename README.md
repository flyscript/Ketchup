### A tile-matching mobile game with a path-finding algorithm to enforce match validation

Only two 90 degree turns are allowed to draw an otherwise straight line between tiles of the same colour for a match to be valid, at which point they're removed from the board, opening up opportunities for other matches.

Path-finding algorithm is made from scratch, with some basic principles of A* applied during the development process.

Some more optimisations yet to be made, but the basics are there!
